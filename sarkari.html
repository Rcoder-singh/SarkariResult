        including the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), Intelligence Bureau
        (IB), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Criminal Investigation
        Department (CID). To be eligible for a job with IPS, there are

        following the probation based on performance. During the training
        period, the candidate will be trained in accounting, finance, billing,
        investment, and revenue collection. A PO role allows opportunities for
        career growth to middle and senior management based on performance and
        additional examinations. The starting monthly salary of a PO is about
        INR 57,000 including allowances.

      <h2>Sarkari Result 2024 : SarkariResult.Com</h2>
      <p>
        India has witnessed a high demand for Government jobs for many decades.
        People prefer Government jobs as their career option considering the
        wide variety of benefits that are associated with these. ‘Sarkari
        Naukri’ is a dream for millions of people across the nation, and only a
        few are lucky to land up with such jobs. People tend to take pride in
        having a Sarkari or Government job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Government jobs hold the kind of authority not found in private jobs.
        These also offer job security for a lifetime, and hence a lot of youth
        prefer them. Getting into a Government job requires a person to go
        through multiple levels of tests. These include a written examination,
        interview and sometimes even physical examination. These are competitive
        exams, and millions of people appear for these exams to get into a
        coveted Government job.
      </p>
      <h2>How Competitive Is the Government Job Market?</h2>
      <p>
        There is no doubt that finding an Indian government job is highly
        competitive. The Times of India said it best when they said that the
        numbers are staggering:
      </p>
      <li>2.3 million applications for 368 peon positions in Uttar Pradesh.</li>

      <li>2.5 million applications for 6,000 positions in Bengal</li>
      <li>
        200,000 applications for 1,137 positions as police constables in
        Maharashtra.
      </li>
      <p>
        When the Ministry of Railways started recruiting for around 63,000
        positions, they received more than 19 million (1.9 crores) job
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        With COVID-19, the competition has only increased because of the drop in
        the number of people hired by the government. The central government
        hired 119,000 people in 2021 which is a reduction in almost 32,000 jobs.
        There was a similar drop in 2021 of almost 107,000 people hired by the
        state government. This creates an extremely competitive environment.
        Getting up-to-date information on the latest jobs on Sarkari Result and
        understanding eligibility requirements can help you stand out from the
        crowd. These are of course some of the most coveted roles in India and
        are extremely competitive.
